###### Fractol
Fractol is one of the first graphic projects from the 42 School Common-Core. This project is a fractal generator implemented entirely in C using MiniLibX, the 42 School's own graphics library. The project includes implementations of both the Julia and Mandelbrot fractals.


Fractal Visualization Project
In this project, I have created two fascinating fractals:

Mandelbrot Set
The Mandelbrot Set is generated using the iterative equation:

How to Run
To run this project and visualize the fractals:

Clone the repository.
Compile the code using a C compiler.
Run the executable.

Julia Set: Generate and visualize the Julia fractal with various parameters.
Mandelbrot Set: Generate and visualize the Mandelbrot fractal.
MiniLibX Integration: Utilizes the MiniLibX library for graphical rendering.
Requirements
MiniLibX: Ensure you have the MiniLibX library installed. You can find the installation instructions for your specific system in the MiniLibX repository.
